# BestPriceSearch
My senior capstone project. Allows a user to search for a product among retailers to find the best price.

When starting the program, the inital interface shown below is created. Then, the user is prompted to enter a product name and select the retailers they would like to search from. Once hitting the search button, the first stage of the search is completed and three results for the user determined product are shown. The user is then prompted to hit confirm under the product that is closest to the one they are searching for. Finally, the results will be shown to them with the cheapest price and which retailer to find it.

The following image is the inital interface:
